A file containing a set of functions you want to include in your application.
o create a module just save the code you want in a file with the file extension .py:
or use built in modules
help("modules") and print for full list of modules
pickle is used for serialization
to find all methods of that module help("pickle")
import math as m
math.pi
from math import pi
print(pi)
Module: a single .py file with reusable code.
Package: a directory containing multiple modules with an __init__.py file.

SCOPES
variable scope is where a variable is visible and accessible
scope resolution  LEGB local -> enclosed -> Global -> built-in
def func1():
  a=1
  def func3():
    a=3
    print(a)
  func3()=> prints 3, if func3 has no a, prints 1  local -> enclosed if no x in func1 too searches global

def func2():
  b=2
  print(b)
a is local to func1 func 1 cannot print b
_____________________________________________
if __name__ == "__main__"
if dunder __name__ equals dunder __main__ it means that this script can be imported or run as standalone
_________________________________________
dunder stands 4 double underscore
They are special method names (also called magic methods or special methods) that 
Python uses internally to give classes certain built-in behaviors.
THEY ALLOW THE DEVELOPER TO DEFINE AND CUSTOMZE THE BEHAVIOUR OF OBJS
__init__ is used to construct or create a new object
everything you create in python is really on obj, so a str is a Str
type(func1)=> class "function" instance of object of class function
new_str=str1+str2 => __add__()
len(str)=>string class there is a __len__() method
__str__ vs __repr__

CONTEXT managers
all syntx in py maps back to a dunder method
with is a context manager as variable names
when we do this we utilize a context manager
